BST:
 - A binary tree
 - for every node, 
    all the elements in the left subtree are smaller than the node
    all the elements in the right subtree are greater than the node

Properties:
    - No duplicates
    - If we perform Inorder traversal on BST we get elements in sorted order
    - No. of BST for 'n' Nodes : catalan number (each shape can only be filled in one way to get the same inorder)

Mostly we use linked representation for BST.
