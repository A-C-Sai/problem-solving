radix sort is similar to count and bin sort.

differences:
    1. number of bins depends on the number system (for decimal 10 bins)
    2. Number of passes depends on the largest number
    3. In each pass extract the last digit the the 2nd last ... so on and put it into corresponding bin (use % and /)
    4. copy back to original array in FIFO fashion 


Space in decreased but number of passes increased
