AVL trees - height balanced BSTs

Height of a tree is balanced using:
    balance factor = height of left subtree - height of right subtree
    
    for each node |bf| <= 1 i.e. bf = {-1,0,1}

    In this data structure, the heights of two child subtrees of any node differ by a maximum of one.

    if |bf| <= 1 then node is balanced
    if |bf| > 1 then node is imbalanced

    if any one node is imbalanced then we say the tree is imbalanced

    tree is balanced by performing rotations
