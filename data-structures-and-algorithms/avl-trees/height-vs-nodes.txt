if height is given find (assume height starts from 1)
min nodes:
            0 then 0
    N(h)    1 the 1
            N(h-2)+N(h-1)+1 otherwise

max nodes:
    n = 2^h - 1

if 'N' nodes are given find:

min height = log[2](n+1)
max height = refer to min nodes but look in opposite direction; approx 1.44log[2](n+2)

AVL tree height is always in terms of log.
